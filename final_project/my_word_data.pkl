distrib ution of all of the particip deferr account indic that one pay ment will be made not a cash payment separ from a share distribut the interpret of the administr goe beyond section 63 if that is the case then section 71 should appli this section doe provid for t he phantom stock account to be paid in share howev it state the val ue of the share and result payment amount will be base on the closin g price of enron corp common stock on the januari 1 befor the date of pay ment and such payment shall be made in share of enron corp common stock this would result in approxim 83 share to be distribut for everi share in the account on januari 1 2001 although this would be the most benefici to the particip due to the declin of the valu of enron cor p common stock from 83 to 10 per share this methodolog goe beyond se ction 63 the calcul below illustr the differ in the valu and method of distribut under each of the three interpret section 630909plan administrators0909sect 71 number of

global slide need to go earlier if we are to use the stori i outlin but the global of energi trade slide is about the trade in commod it doesnt fit we are after data on the good and servic that make this trade happen not the commod per se the custom is fine we need to have solid talk point about whi custom of energi servic help economi this will be a tough section i dont think we have anyth in

or wait until we meet on the 15th for my report the offici report should be on the internet monday a meet of the ebn has been schedul in melbourn on march 1819 to coincid with the davo meet they are also talk about an ewg meet in march also i will be late for the meet on the 15th i have a black tie dinner on tuesday night and will take the first plane to houston from new york wednesday am sorri but i cant get out of the dinner it been plan for a long time and i have guest 20 countri were present if you look back on the agenda for the 18th meet of the ewg busi network on novemb 1819 in wellington four agenda item were of particular interest to the energi busi network 1 the report on the 2nd meet of the ebn meet we were forewarn that the activ of the ebn would be under attack by the japanes chines and mexican 2 the discuss and report on the ewg implement committe visit team to thailand 810 novemb 1999 3 the doe recommend on a propos plan of work on energi servic again veri controversi 4 the propos energi ministeri in the us in the spring mexico china and japan were not happi with the proactiv push of the ebn i assum it was mexico that made sure we were exclud from the discuss on the thai visit and energi servic two ebn initi barri and i would onli be allow in the room for the ebn report someth i protest prior to the meet with the help of tim mackey we somewhat circumv the restrict by his go around the room one by one after barri report ask for reaction to what was said this forc a discuss with us in the room both barri and i respond to the issu rais the dissent maintain that the ebn was work too fast and that we were take the initi away from the ewg and becom too independ japan support the concept of the ebn but made it clear that it was the ewg that set initi the ebn summari of decis was a particular affront we had strong support from australia canada korea masia new zealand the philippin they are concern that the ebn not duplic ewg initi singapor thailand and the us china surpris us by complain that the ewg and ebn meet were now separ not back to back barri explain this was more an accid that anyth els it took some effort but i think we made our case i emphas strong that the ebn consist of some of the best and brightest in the energi industri and that we would not be shi about offer our idea we oper with a great sens of urgenc see that apec will eventu 30 trillion of invest to meet their energi need each economi could accept of reject these idea but i doubt they want to be a rubber stamp for the ewg as for energi servic as i understood it the doe program was design to get the ewg up to speed on what energi servic are an educ effort that compliment what is go on at the wto servic repres stage three in energi develop that would increas the effici of the infrastructur and offer new product and servic to user of energi the key discuss would occur on friday in our absenc there were two offici report on the thai meet one by the secretariat which was more of a recap of the process and agenda with no evalu of the success and one by the thai the last paragraph of which was veri favor iron the controversi concern the process by which we particip were chosen no one has been abl to explain to me whi the ewg would care about this issu and i honest believ that the usg was a major factor in stir this up and when you cut through the bull it about exert control over the ewg again everyon was in support of the consult process and the valu it bring in open dialogu on difficult issu i note that the thai should get particular credit for be so open and candid in the discuss in our absenc there was a long discuss on the energi principl endors by the ebn which were turn back into an energi charter they agre that an energi charter statement would be draft by the secretariat and circul to member economi the implement committe discuss on friday was support but as i note but focus on the process not as i emphas it should be on the result which were a success they was strong support led by doeusg to elimin the steer and implement committe i did not see the final languag and was present with two conflict version one that letter request a visit would go to the secretariat who would forward them to the ewg and ebn for suggest on who should particip the secretariat decid and one where the secretariat send the request to the ewg and they consult with their ebn repres and decid i made it clear that the latter process was unaccept and the ebn would strong oppos it this process would take month and the ewg was in no posit to decid who could best provid the peopl to address an economi specif request i told this to the usg deleg and they assur me the former would be the model well see energi servic was also a long discuss and the japanes focus on sever this initi from anyth to do with the wto in my privat discuss with the japanes they express the concern that this could be consid an endors of the liber of energi servic and use against them in the wto negoti again i didnt see the final outcom but i understand that at the next ewg meet will present a trim own version of the work plan minus ani refer to the wto it was agre that there should be a seminar on the topic but the ewg would onli consid a seminar at the next meet this is way to slow and barri and david think we need to get a white paper befor the ewg in the next few month and push for a seminar at the next ewg meet this is awkward for me sinc the us ebn has no posit but the  ebn support this effort as doe the usg and we need to work with everyon to make the effort a success with great skeptic that the us can organ a ministeri in five month edmonton took ten month the ewg agre to a ministeri may 812 at the ewg meet on thursday i push the idea that the day befor the offici meet should be dedic to a seri of direct interact with the busi communiti much like the latin meet in new orlean the usg said they will includ this idea in their propos at the januari steer meet the ministeri will be on the west coast i am glad that i was there even though mani of the discuss were pain we beat down and reconfirm strong support for the ebn although it may be water down energi servic is still on the tabl and can still be a valuabl educ process while meet the concern of some of the us ebn member the consult process is aliv and well well see if it been wound and we may have a great  in may for direct interact with the energi minist wish you had been there it rain for four day skeannsf the attach cover whi i will be in india all

variabl oper expens tha t is deposit into a new york eogil account and immedi swept to an en ron corp account current edf therefor this sub is self suffici and should be abl to handl all plan 2002 extraordinari capit or ope rate expens the onli nearterm issu is our estim tax payment tha t is due 121501 of 64 mm for the 4th quarter of 2001 sinc all of ou r money is immedi swept to edf we do not have these fund on hand and we will not receiv enough cash prior to the 15th to make this payment t herefor if we want to be self suffici a we need to retain ani new fu nds in our eogil account and b ani deficit can be borrow from egep ass ume it is fund as describ below and repaid to egep from 2002 cashflo ws egep is the houston base technic arm and manag for eogil we have 40 peopl that work direct on the eogil asset we had over 100 peopl la st year and have cut staff to current level as we sold asset and these p eopl are current pledg to british gas for a 60 day transit period i f and when we close the sale of eogil to bg all of these peopl will be s ever after the transit period and they all know this is their fate th ey have known this sinc octob 2000 the reason they are still here is for two reason 1 divestitur agreement and 2 sever payment if w e can not guarante payrol sever and divestitur we will lose peopl immedi most of the staff can walk to eogr at ani time and without s ome comfort regard sever and divestitur i know they will leav whi ch put us in jeopardi for a maintain our oper and operatorship b be abl to fulfil our contractu commit to bg or c lose the talent necessari to remarket if we cant close the bg deal 20 operatorship is a veri valuabl commod and retain it for resal is w orth 5075 million even if we elect to sell to an indian compani in ord r to retain operatorship it is vital that we retain the current staff i realiz this may seem trivial in the larger scope of thing but in light of the reason we are look into this matter of keep our cash generat ing sub oper have money for these item will be essenti egep s month ga is approxim 18 mm per month enron oblig to the employe in the form of sever and divestitur is approxim 10 million therefor i would recommend that we deposit 15mm into the egep account to cover known commit and we will bill futur month of egep ga either to eogil or bg whichev is appropri furthermor eogil ca n use

is also import to be clear as to what has alreadi been identifi and is be address and how while i understand that part of the idea of doorstep is to rattl the cage of the commerci manag it is import to check if my cage is alreadi rattl as it was in this case john and i would alway expect to see and discuss a report befor it is discuss in houston unless there is a veri good reason to do otherwis i take ani issu of a control natur veri serious but my approach is to insist on a verif of the fact befor make ani judgement which doe lead to some de on occas while fact are be gather what i would also like in addit to a brief and discuss at the start of the review is a debrief from the team to get their impress direct both as to the issu and also as to how my control team are do there is alway a question of prioritis of resourc particular in busi like metal which will be a constant challeng go forward you will have similar issu on steel etc and i would like the doorstep team to provid me with their input on whether they agre with our approach and also to discuss area where i think an addit doorstep review may be help i know you are work on the doorstep process with mike jordan but i would

has realiz extra valu from the eecc model sinc 1990 b eecc has taken an enron liabil construct risk and turn it into an asset net incom the risk was incur by enron decis to build asset around the

incom for enron d in addit eecc has perform the work general in a manner superior to the rest of the industri we have avoid disast experienc by brown and root black and veatch snamprogetti raytheon and stone and webster which presum could have occur while perform enron work weve out perform them becaus we had better risk manag  e cost avoid in addit to perform this work at market price and at the same time make 250mm net incom as jack urquhart point out at the last board meet we have avoid ten and ten of million of dollar of extra cost dure execut the enron portfolio of construct risk averag in billion of dollar so even 1 or 2 percent in nuisancetyp chang order from outsid contractor would have ad up to substanti extra cost f roic as we recogn the enron deal flow was decreas we were ask in the last two to three budget cycl to maintain or grow our net incom therefor we embark on nonenron thirdparti construct busi this margin incom has increas our use of work capit still this

disast experienc by brown and root black and veatch snamprogetti raytheon and stone and webster which presum could have occur while perform enron work weve out perform them becaus we had better risk

two major issu i the integr which we believ we have more or less under control and ii the capit structur of the result system which is depend in the first instanc on the time of the sierra auction concern integr the question is whether sierra blend approach that is a 50 mw longterm firm path between pge and nevada power and a combin of nonfirm and shortterm firm link sierra to the rest of the system is beyond current sec preced in aep and xcel the sec found that a longterm firm path was suffici to establish that two part of a system were physic interconnect or capabl of interconnect although xcel also involv the use of a nonfirm path that was on an interim basi pend the complet of certain upgrad necessari for the firm contract path absent some statement to the contrari it is our understand that the staff would not approv the blend approach by deleg author there is howev an altern approach to integr under which we would ask the sec staff to find that pge and nevada were integr and that sierra constitut a permiss addit system under the abc claus of section 11b1 sierra has complet the studi need to justifi this approach base on convers with bob wason and cathey baker on the sec staff we believ that this approach could be approv by deleg author concern the capit structur of the result system there is a percept on the part of the staff that sierra is signific overextend as you know the sec general requir regist hold compani to maintain a minimum of 30 common equiti while there is preced to support a floor of 276 the staff has advis compani that they will requir a minimum of 285 equiti with a commit to reach 30 within a reason period of time befor approv a matter pursuant to deleg author there is some confus about sierra prospect in this regard the most recent amend file june 14th indic that sierra will be at 208 common equiti at close with a represent that sierra will increas it consolid common equiti to approxim 29 percent as a result of a proceed from the sale of generat asset of sierra pacif and nevada power aggreg approxim 1 billion 100 percent of which will reduc debt of the consolid compani b proceed from divestitur of noncor asset or some

million of hybrid secur and d increas retain earn realiz from the combin oper of sierra and pge aggreg approxim 80 million in 2000 and 100 million in 2001 it is unclear how good these number are they do not for exampl reflect sierra second quarter earn releas or the effect of a writeoff in connect with pges trojan plant bill weeden will be meet with mark ruell thursday to come up with firm number in other matter the sec staff has indic that it would give credit toward equiti capit if the compani has execut definit agreement for sale of the subject asset such as the sierra water busi and it generat asset it is import to know when such sale may be announc so that we can factor them into our calcul assum that sierra can establish base on these type of definit agreement that the merg
